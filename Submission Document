The algorithm is trained with documents found online that have nothing to do with specific audience targeted (we didn't specify whether the input will be from a middle schooler, a PhD student and so forth). The performance of the algorithm should be significantly improved if more suited documents are used for its training (specific textbooks the users are learning from, user age etc.).

The training document for spellchecker is a corpus for Sherlock Holmes, so better results for misspelling math words would be attained if there were a larger pool of mathematical documents that could be used for the training. For example "cumplit" is corrected into "culprit" rather than "complete". 

We haven't been able to develop an algorithm that would account for phonetic misspelling. For example, translating "da" into "the" ("cumplit da scware" into "complete the square") and such. 

Also, the statements which contain a complete negation of a method will be accounted for ("I want to use quadratic formula and not the complete the square method"), but semantic negation hasn't been accounted for ("I want to use the quadratic formula because complete the square is too complicated") with the assumption that those inputs will be minimal.
