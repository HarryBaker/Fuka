Previously, I'd solved this by factoring the difference of squares, and solving each factor; the solution was "x = ± 2". However—

I can also try isolating the squared variable term, putting the number over on the other side, like this:

x2 – 4 = 0 
x2 = 4

I know that, when solving an equation, I can do whatever I like to that equation as long as I do the same thing to both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side of this particular equation, I have an x2, and I need a plain x. To turn an x2 into an x, I can take the square root of each side of the equation:

sqrt(x) = ± sqrt(4)

x = ± 2

Then the solution is x = ± 2

Why did I need the "±" ("plus-minus") sign on the 2 when I took the square root of the 4? Because it might have been a positive 2 or a negative 2 that was squared to get that 4 in the original equation.

Warning: Finding the solution, above, is a very different process from "evaluating the square root of 4". When finding the square root of a number, you know that you're dealing with a positive result, because that is how the square root of a number is defined. Solving an equation, on the other hand — finding all of the possible values of the variable that will work in the equation — is different from just evaluating an expression that is already defined to have only one value.

Remember: a square-rooted number has only one value, but a square-rooted equation has two, because of the variable.

The answer I got above, with the "±" sign, matches the solution I got when I solved this equation using the difference-of-squares factoring formula. Thus, this result confirms the need to use the "±" sign when solving by square-rooting. (In mathematics, you need to be able to get the same answer, no matter which valid method you happen to have used in order to arrive at that answer.)

A benefit of this square-rooting process is that it allows us to solve some quadratics that we could not have solved before. For instance:

Solve x2 – 50 = 0.
This quadratic has a squared part and a number part. I'll start by adding the numerical term to the other side of the equaion (so the squared part is by itself), and then I'll square-root both sides. I'll need to remember to simplify the square root:

x2 – 50 = 0 
x2 = 50 
x = ± 5sqrt(2)

Then the solution is  x = ± 5 sqrt(2)

While we could have gotten the previous integer solution by factoring, we could never have gotten this radical solution by factoring. Factoring is clearly useful, but additional techniques can allow us to find solutions to additional sorts of equations.

Solve (x – 5)2 – 100 = 0.
This quadratic has a squared part and a number part. I'll start by adding the number to the other side of the equation, so the squared binomial is by itself. Then I'll square-root both sides, remembering to simplify my results:

(x – 5)2 – 100 = 0 
(x – 5)2 = 100 
sqrt[ (x - 5)^2 ] = ± sqrt(100)
x – 5 = ±10 
x = 5 ± 10 
x = 5 – 10  or  x = 5 + 10 
x = –5   or  x = 15

Since the equation, after square-rooting, did not contain any square roots, I was able to simplify down to simple values. Copyright © Elizabeth Stapel 2002-2011 All Rights Reserved

The solution is x = –5, 15

This example points out the importance of remembering the "±" when you square-root both sides:

Warning: Many students develop the bad habit of not bothering to write the "±" sign until they check their answers in the back of the book and "remember" that they "meant" to put the "±" in there when they took the square roots of either side of their equation. However, that generally only works when the solution involves square roots (and only when you actually have the solution, which isn't the case on tests). The above is an example of a problem where the careless student will omit the "±" and then have no clue how the book got the answer "x = – 5, 15". Don't be that student; always remember to insert the "±".

By the way, since the solution to the equation consisted of nice neat "whole" numbers, this quadratic could also have been solved by multiplying out the square and simplifying to get "x2 – 10x – 75", which then could have been factored as "(x – 15)(x + 5)".

Solve (x – 2)2 – 12 = 0
This quadratic has a squared part and a number part. I'll add the number to the other side (so the squared part is by itself), and then I'll square-root both sides, remembering to simplify:

(x – 2)2 – 12 = 0 
(x – 2)2 = 12 
x = 2 ± 2sqrt(3)

Then the solution is  x = 2 ± 2 sqrt(3)

This quadratic equation, unlike the previous one, could not be solved by factoring. But how would I have solved it, if they had not given me the quadratic already put into "(squared part) minus (a number)" form? This concern leads to the next topic: "completing the square".
Solving Quadratic Equations Using Square Roots
The general form of a quadratic equation is:

If b = 0, the equation can solved by putting it in the form

x2=d

for some new constant d

, and taking the square root of both sides. (Both positive and negative square roots count. because we want all of the numbers that solve the equation.) Again, this easy method of solution only works in the special case when b=0

There are two solutions to the equation.

The easiest possible quadratic equation to solve would be something like x2 = 9, so we won't be dealing with anything more complicated than that.

Psych! (Sorry.)

If the square of x is 9, then x can be the positive or negative square root of 9:

x2 = 9


This simplifies to:

x = ±3

All we need to do is remember to keep both the positive and negative square roots. Sometimes after taking the square root, though, we need to do a little more work. Put your back into it.

Sample Problem

Solve: (x + 3)2 = 9.

If the square of x + 3 is 9, then x + 3 can be either the positive or negative square root of 9. In other words, we're taking the square root of both sides to knock out that exponent.

(x + 3)2 = 9
x + 3 = ±3

Now we need to solve two equations. Quickly, before the amount of work we need to do doubles again:

x + 3 = 3 and x + 3 = -3

For the first equation, if x + 3 = 3, then x = 0.

We're always paranoid that we might have done something wrong, so we'll check to make sure that this works. When we plug in x = 0 to the left-hand side of the original equation, we find:

(0 + 3)2 = 9

Yep, that's true. So x = 0 is a solution to the equation. Halfway home.

Now for the second equation. If x + 3 = -3, then x = -6.

Uh-oh. Our paranoia is setting in again, so it's time to check to see that this works. When we plug in x = -6 to the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

(-6 + 3)2 = 9
(-3)2 = 9

Hey, that's also true. Therefore, x = -6 is also a solution to the equation.

The final answer: both x = 0 and x = -6 are solutions to the equation. There's room in this town for the both of them.

The examples we've done so far have had a squared variable on one side and a number on the other. If we have an expression that's a square multiplied or divided by something, we need to "undo" that multiplication or division before taking the square root. Unfortunately, we can't just hit "Control Z."

Sample Problem

Solve: 2x2 = 72.

First we divide both sides by 2 to find an equation that has a square on one side:

x2 = 36

Then we can take the square root of 36:

x = ±6

Sometimes we might see an equation has the square of a first-degree polynomial on one side, but the square is in disguise and needs to be factored. Watch for trench coats and low-brimmed hats.

The last few sample problems were all well and good, but solutions to quadratic equations don't always result in beautiful numbers. For example, take the ugly side of quadratic equations. Try not to look directly at them, though, since we don't want you to go blind.

Of course, we could put together all the things that can happen to make something horribly complicated, and trust us, we will. Cue maniacal laugh.

Sample Problem

Solve 18x2 + 12x + 2 = 7.

First, we can factor the left-hand side:

2(9x2 + 6x + 1) = 7
2(3x + 1)2 = 7

We want a square on one side of the equation, so divide both sides by 2:



Now that we have a square on one side, we can take the square root of both sides:



We solve the two equations:



Hit both of 'em individually to get our two solutions:



These solutions can be rewritten, or simplified:



These look like a nightmare you might have after consuming too much dairy right before bed, but they're absolutely correct. In fact, check the first solution. Plugging it into the original equation would be the ideal thing to do, but this isn't an ideal world, and that arithmetic would be too messy. Instead, since we're confident we rearranged the equation correctly at the beginning, plug the solution into (3x + 1)2 and make sure we get . Here goes:



Made it, Ma! Top of the world!

The general plan of attack for solving this sort of equation is to attack quickly and aggressively from the left flank. No, wait, that's the general plan for attacking a right-handed enemy in a mountainous region. Never mind us.

The real plan of attack is to manipulate the equation so there's something squared on one side and a number on the other side, even if it gives you something truly awful to look at. Take the appropriate square root, and then solve each new equation you find. Remember, you can always check that your answers are right by plugging them back into the original equation and making sure they work. If they don't, try replacing the batteries before giving up. They take Triple-As.

Of course, this won't work for a quadratic equation that has no real number solutions, like the equation (x + 1)2 = -3.

This can't possibly have real number solutions, since there's no way to square a real number (x + 1) and end up with -3. We've tried. A lot. Can't be done.
Some quadratic equations have only two terms, like a number subtracted from a term with a squared variable, such as:

examples of equations
If you have a quadratic equation like one of these, it's really easy to solve. Just follow these two easy steps.

1. First, get the squared variable by itself on one side of the equal side.

step 1 in solving a quadratic equation
2. Second, take the square root of both sides of your equation.

solving a quadratic equation - step 2
Why did we have two answers for x? Remember that if you square 3 or -3, you still get 9, so the square root of 9 includes both 3 and -3.
A quadratic equation can be solved by taking the square root of both sides of the equation. This method uses the square root property,
