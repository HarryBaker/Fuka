Required before running the code: 

1. Make sure you have a Python IDE. 

2. Make sure you have a C compiler before installing gensim, to use optimized (compiled) word2vec training. 
             
        ***  More information on word2vec training 

3. Getting the gensim package:  Installation information to be found here. 


The algorithm is trained with documents found online that have nothing to do with specific audience targeted (we didn't take into account whether the input will be from a middle schooler, a PhD student and so forth). The performance of the algorithm should be significantly improved if more suited documents are used for its training (specific textbooks the users are learning from, user age etc.). 

To see sample input and output, run demo.py.
