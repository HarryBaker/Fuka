There's no magic to solving quadratic equations.  Quadratic equations can be solved by factoring and also by graphing.
 

The factoring method of solution:
Let's do a quick review of factoring.
(If you need a more in-depth look at factoring, check the Factoring Section of this site.)

There are primarily three types of factoring:



*Common Monomial	
ab + ac = a(b + c)

*Difference of Squares	x2 - 9 = (x +3)(x - 3)
*Quadratic Trinomial	x2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 3)(x - 2)
If you can factor, you will be able to solve factorable quadratic equations.
Let's see how it is done.
 

Solve for x:    
                                          Here are the steps you should follow:

1.	Move all terms to the same side of the equal sign, so the equation is set equal to 0.	
This places the equation in standard form.
2.	Factor the algebraic expression.	
(x + 3) and (x + 2) are called factors.  These are factors of the expression
 x2 - x - 6.
3.	Set each factor equal to 0.
(This process is called the "zero product property".  If the product of two factors equals 0, then either one or both of the factors must be 0.)	
4.	Solve each resulting equation.	
x = 3  and  x = -2 are called roots.  These are roots of the equation x2 - x - 6 = 0.

 

Example 1

Solve for x:    x2 + 3x = 0

Factor the common monomial.	            x(x + 3)=0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x.	
x = 0 

 	x + 3 = 0
x = -3
List all values of x.	x = {0, -3}


 

Example 2

Solve for y:     y 2 = 16

Get all terms on the same side.	           y 2 - 16 = 0
Factor the difference of squares.	        (y + 4)(y - 4) =0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for y.	
y + 4 = 0
y = -4

 	y - 4 = 0
y = 4
List all values of y.	y = {-4, 4}


 

Example 3

Solve for c:   c 2 - 12 = c

Get all terms on the same side.	          c 2 - 12 - c =0
Arrange the terms in standard form.	          c 2 - c - 12 = 0
Factor the quadratic trinomial.	         (c + 3)(c - 4) = 0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for c.	
c + 3 = 0
c = -3

 	c - 4 = 0
c = 4
List all values of c.	c = {-3, 4}


 

Example 4

Solve for x:    

Employ "product of the means = product of the extremes" (cross-multiply) for this proportion.	
Get all terms on the same side.	    x 2 - 1296 = 0
Factor the difference of squares.	       (x + 36)(x - 36) =0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x.	
x + 36 = 0
x = -36

 	
x - 36 = 0
x = 36

List all values of x.	x = {-36, 36}


 

Example 5

Solve for x:    

Employ "product of the means = product of the extremes" (cross-multiply) for this proportion. 	
Get all terms on the same side.	    0 = 2x 2 - 6x - 8
Factor the common monomial.	0 = 2(x 2 - 3x - 4)
Factor the quadratic trinomial.	  2(x - 4)(x + 1) =0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x.	


 	


 	
x + 1 = 0
x = -1

List all values of x.	x = {-1, 4}


 

Example 6

Write a quadratic equation, in the form  ax2 + bx + c = 0, whose roots are 2 and 5.

The simplest answer will be an equation where the factors of the expression are
(x - 2) and (x - 5).  Create this equation.	(x - 2)(x - 5) = 0
Multiply.	    x 2 - 5x - 2x + 10 = 0
Combine to get an answer equation.	x 2 - 7x + 10 = 0


 

Example 7

The square of a number exceeds 5 times the number by 24.  Find the number(s).   

Translate the problem into a mathematical equation. 	x2 = 5x + 24
Get all terms on the same side.	    x 2 - 5x - 24 = 0
Factor the difference of squares.	       (x - 8)(x + 3) =0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x.	
x - 8 = 0
x = 8

 	
x + 3 = 0
x = -3

List all values of x.	x = {8, -3}


 

Example 8

In football, the height of the football reached during a pass can be modeled by the equation  h = -16t 2 + 28t + 6, where the height, h, is in feet and the time, t, is in seconds.  How long does it take for this ball to reach a height of 12 feet?  

Substitute 12 into the equation for h.	12 = -16t 2 + 28t + 6
Get all terms on the same side.  Move terms to the left side to avoid working with a negative leading coefficient.	    16t 2 - 28t + 6 = 0
Factor the quadratic trinomial.	       (4t - 1)(4t - 6) =0
Set each factor equal to 0 and solve for t.	
4t - 1 = 0
 4t = 1
t = 1/4
 

 	
4t - 6 = 0
4t = 6
t = 6/4=3/2

List all values of t that are positive.  Negative time, should it appear, is not considered an answer.	t = {1/4, 3/2}.  Reaches a height of 12 feet when time is 0.25 seconds (ball going up) and 1.5 seconds (ball coming down).



 

 

The graphing method of solution:
Quadratic equations can also be solved by graphing.  Graphing can be done "by hand" or with the use of a graphing calculator.  The locations where the graph intersects (crosses) the x-axis will be the solutions to the equation.  These locations are called the roots of the equation.
A quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax 2 + bx + c = 0 , where a≠ 0 , and a , b , and c are real numbers.

Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

We can often factor a quadratic equation into the product of two binomials. We are then left with an equation of the form (x + d )(x + e) = 0 , where d and e are integers.

The zero product property states that, if the product of two quantities is equal to 0 , then at least one of the quantities must be equal to zero. Thus, if (x + d )(x + e) = 0 , either (x + d )= 0 or (x + e) = 0 . Consequently, the two solutions to the equation are x = - d and x = - e .

Example 1: Solve for x : x 2 - 5x - 14 = 0 

x 2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 
x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0 
x = 7 or x = - 2 

Thus, the solution set is { -2, 7} .

Example 2: Solve for x : x 2 + 6x + 5 = 0 

x 2 + 6x + 5 = (x + 1)(x + 5) = 0 
x + 1 = 0 or x + 5 = 0 
x = - 1 or x = - 5 

Thus, the solution set is { -1, -5} .

Example 3: Solve for x : 2x 2 - 16x + 24 = 0 

2x 2 -16x + 24 = 2(x 2 - 8x + 12) = 2(x - 2)(x - 6) = 0 
x - 2 = 0 or x - 6 = 0 
x = 2 or x = 6 

Thus, the solution set is {2, 6} .

Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

This lesson covers many ways to solve quadratics, such as taking square roots, completing the square, and using the Quadratic Formula. But we'll start with solving by factoring.

You should already know how to factor quadratics. (If not, review Factoring Quadratics.) The new thing here is that the quadratic is part of an equation, and you're told to solve for the values of x that make the equation true. Here's how it works:

Solve (x – 3)(x – 4) = 0.
Okay, this one is already factored for me. But how do I solve this?

Think: If I multiply two things together and the result is zero, what can I say about those two things? I can say that at least one of them must also be zero. That is, the only way to multiply and get zero is to multiply by zero. (This is sometimes called "The Zero Factor Property" or "Rule" or "Principle".)

Warning: You cannot make this statement about any other number! You can only make the conclusion about the factors ("one of them must equal zero") if the product itself equals zero. If the above product of factors had been equal to, say, 4, then we would still have no idea what was the value of either of the factors; we would not have been able (we would not have been mathematically "justified") in making any claim about the values of the factors. Because you can only make the conclusion ("one of the factors must have equalled zero") if the product equals zero, you must always have the equation in the form "(quadratic) equals (zero)" before you can attempt to solve it.

The Zero Factor Principle tells me that at least one of the factors must be equal to zero. Since at least one of the factors must be zero, I'll set them eachequal to zero:

x – 3 = 0   or   x – 4 = 0

This gives me simple linear equations, and they're easy to solve:

x = 3  or  x = 4

And this is the solution they're looking for:  x = 3, 4

Note that "x = 3, 4" means the same thing as "x = 3  or  x = 4"; the only difference is the formatting. The "x = 3, 4" format is more-typically used.

One important issue should be mentioned at this point: Just as with linear equations, the solutions to quadratic equations may be verified by plugging them back into the original equation, and making sure that they work, that they result in a true statement. For the above example, we would do the following:

 

ADVERTISEMENT

 

Checking x = 3 in (x – 3)(x – 4) = 0:

([3] – 3)([3] – 4) ?=? 0 
     (3 – 3)(3 – 4) ?=? 0 
               (0)(–1) ?=? 0 
                       0   =   0

Checking x = 4 in (x – 3)(x – 4) = 0:

([4] – 3)([4] – 4) ?=? 0 
     (4 – 3)(4 – 4) ?=? 0 
                 (1)(0) ?=? 0 
                       0   =   0

So both solutions "check" and are thus verified as being correct.

Solve x2 + 5x + 6 = 0.
This equation is already in the form "(quadratic) equals (zero)" but, unlike the previous example, this isn't yet factored. The quadratic must first be factored, because it is only when you MULTIPLY and get zero that you can say anything about the factors and solutions. You can't conclude anything about the individual terms of the unfactored quadratic (like the 5x or the 6), because you can add lots of stuff that totals zero.

So the first thing I have to do is factor:

x2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

Set this equal to zero:

(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0

Solve each factor: Copyright © Elizabeth Stapel 2002-2011 All Rights Reserved

x + 2 = 0  or  x + 3 = 0 
x = –2  or  x = – 3

The solution to x2 + 5x + 6 = 0 is x = –3, –2

Checking x = –3 and x = –2 in x2 + 5x + 6 = 0:

[–3]2 + 5[–3] + 6 ?=? 0 
           9 – 15 + 6 ?=? 0 
           9 + 6 – 15 ?=? 0 
               15 – 15 ?=? 0 
                        0   =   0

[–2]2 + 5[–2] + 6 ?=? 0 
           4 – 10 + 6 ?=? 0 
           4 + 6 – 10 ?=? 0 
               10 – 10 ?=? 0 
                        0   =   0

So both solutions "check".

Solve x2 – 3 = 2x.
This equation is not in "(quadratic) equals (zero)" form, so I can't try to solve it yet. The first thing I need to do is get all the terms over on one side, with zero on the other side. Only then can I factor and solve:

x2 – 3 = 2x 
x2 – 2x – 3 = 0 
(x – 3)(x + 1) = 0 
x – 3 = 0  or  x + 1 = 0 
x = 3  or  x = –1

Then the solution to x2 – 3 = 2x is x = –1, 3

Solve (x + 2)(x + 3) = 12.
It is very common for students to see this type of problem, and say:

"Cool! It's already factored! So I'll set the factors equal to 12 and 
solve to get x = 10 and x = 9. That was easy!"

Yeah, it was easy; it was also (warning!) wrong. Besides the fact that (10 + 2)(9 + 3) does not equal 12, you should never forget that you must have "(quadratic) equals (zero)" before you can solve.

So, tempting though it may be, I cannot set each of the factors above equal to the other side of the equation and "solve". Instead, I first have to multiply out and simplify the left-hand side, then subtract the 12 over to the left-hand side, and re-factor. Only then can I solve.

(x + 2)(x + 3) = 12 
x2 + 5x + 6 = 12 
x2 + 5x – 6 = 0 
(x + 6)(x – 1) = 0 
x + 6 = 0  or   x – 1 = 0 
x = –6  or   x = 1

Then the solution to (x + 2)(x + 3) = 12 is x = –6, 1

Solve x(x + 5) = 0.
A very common mistake that students make on this type of problem is to "solve" the equation for "x + 5 = 0" by dividing off the x. But you can't divide by zero; dividing off the x makes the implicit assumption that x is not zero. There is no justification for making that assumption! And (warning!) making that (implicit) assumption will cause you to lose half of your solution to this problem.

Even though you are used to variable factors having variables and numbers (like the other factor, x + 5), a factor can contain only a variable, so "x" is a perfectly valid factor. So set the factors equal to zero, and solve:

x(x + 5) = 0 
x = 0  or  x + 5 = 0 
x = 0  or  x = –5

Then the solution to x(x + 5) = 0 is x = 0, –5

Solve x2 – 5x = 0.
This two-term quadratic is easier to factor than were the previous quadratics: I can factor an x out of both terms, taking the x out front. (Warning: Do not "divide the x off", do not make it magically "disappear", or you'll lose one of your solutions!)

x(x – 5) = 0 
x = 0  or  x – 5 = 0 
x = 0  or  x = 5

Then the solution to x2 – 5x = 0 is x = 0, 5

There is one other case of two-term quadratics that you can factor:

Solve x2 – 4 = 0.
This equation is in "(quadratic) equals (zero)" form, so it's ready to solve. The quadratic itself is a difference of squares, so I'll apply the difference-of-squares formula:

x2 – 4 = 0 
(x – 2)(x + 2) = 0 
x – 2 = 0  or  x + 2 = 0 
x = 2  or  x = –2

Then the solution is x = –2, 2

Note: This solution may also be formatted as "x = ± 2".

There is another way to work this last problem, which leads us to the next section...

Set up your expression. The standard format for the quadratic equation is:

ax2 + bx + c = 0

Start by ordering the terms in your equation from highest to lowest power, just like this standard format. For example, take:

6 + 6x2 + 13x = 0

We will re-order this expression so it's easier to work with by simply moving the terms around:

6x2 + 13x + 6 = 0
Find the factored form using one of the methods below. Factoring the polynomial will result in two smaller expressions which can be multiplied to produce the original polynomial:

6x2 + 13x + 6 = (2x + 3)(3x + 2)

In this example, (2x +3) and (3x + 2) are factors of the original expression, 6x2 + 13x + 6.

Check your work! Multiply the factors you identified. Then combine like terms and you're done. Start with:

(2x + 3)(3x + 2)

Let's test it, multiplying the terms using FOIL (first - outer - inner - last), obtaining:

6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6

From here, we can add 4x and 9x together since they're like terms. We know our factors are correct because we get the equation we started with:

6x2 + 13x + 6

Introduction
 
When any polynomial is set equal to a certain value (whether an integer or another polynomial), the result is an equation. An equation that can be written in the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation. We can solve these quadratic equations by using the rules of algebra, applying factoring techniques where necessary, and by using the Zero Product Property.
 
The Zero Product Property
 
The Zero Product Property states (in algebraic terms, of course!) something that we all have known for a long time: if the product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the factors is 0.
 
Zero Product Property
 
If ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0, or both a and b are 0.
 
 
This property may seem fairly obvious, but it has big implications for how we solve quadratic equations: it means that if we have a factored polynomial equal to 0, we can be sure that at least one of the factors is also 0. We can use this method to identify solutions for the equation.
 
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves here—let’s start with an example of a quadratic equation and think about how we can solve it. The equation 5a2 + 15a = 0 is a quadratic equation because it can be written as 5a2 + 15a + 0 = 0, which fits the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, with c = 0.
 
Example
Problem
 
Solve 5a2 + 15a = 0 for a
 
 
 
5a2 + 15a = 0
 
The problem asks us to solve for a; let’s begin by factoring the left side of the equation.
 
5(a2 + 3a) = 0
 
5 is a common factor of 5a2 and 15a.
 
5a(a + 3) = 0
 
a is a common factor of a2 and 3a.
 
At this point we have fully factored the left side of the equation. If we were just factoring the expression, we could stop here, but remember that we are solving the equation for a.
 
Here’s where we use the Zero Product Property. Since the entire expression is equal to zero, we know that at least one of the terms, 5a or (a + 3), has to be equal to zero. Let’s continue to solve this problem by setting each term equal to zero and solving the
equations.
 
 
5a = 0                     a + 3 = 0
 
Set each factor equal to zero
 
         a + 3 – 3 = 0 – 3
 
a = 0                          a = -3     
 
 
Solve each equation
Answer
a = 0 OR a = -3     
 
 
 
We end up with two possible values for a: 0 and -3. (These values are also called the roots of an equation.) To check our answers, we can substitute both values directly into our original equation and see if we get a true sentence for each.
 
Checking a = 0
Checking a = -3
5a2 + 15a = 0
5a2 + 15a = 0
5(0)2 + 15(0) = 0
5(-3)2 + 15(-3) = 0
5(0) + 0 = 0
5(9) – 45 = 0
0 + 0 = 0
45 – 45 = 0
0 = 0
0 = 0
 
Substituting these values into the original equation produces two correct statements, so we know that our values for a are correct! This quadratic equation, 5a2 + 15a = 0, has two roots: 0 and -3.
 
We can use the same Zero Product Property to solve quadratic equations in the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. First we factor the expression, and then we will solve for the roots.
 
 
Example
Problem
Solve for r.
r2 – 5r + 6 = 0.
 
 
 
r2 – 3r – 2r + 6 = 0
 
 
Expand the -5r  term using two coefficients whose sum is -5 and whose product is 6.
 
(r2 – 3r) – (2r – 6) = 0
 
 
Group terms
 
r(r – 3) – 2(r – 3) = 0
 
 
Pull out the common factors from each group.
 
(r – 3)(r – 2) = 0
 
Use the Distributive Property to pull out (r – 3) as a factor.
 
r – 3 = 0
r – 2 = 0
Use the Zero Product Property to set each factor equal to 0.
 
r = 3
r  = 2
Solve each equation.
Answer
 
r = 3 OR r = 2
 
The roots of the original equation are 3 or 2.
 
The solution to this equation, then, is r = 2 or r = 3, as both of these values for r will result in a true statement. (Skeptical? Substitute values of 2 and 3 in for r in the original equation. We'll wait.)
 
Solve for h:
 
h(2h + 5) = 0
 
A) h = 0
 
B) h = 2 or 5
 
C) h = 0 or 2.5
 
D) h = 0 or -2.5

Applying the Zero Product Property
 
When we use the Zero Product Property to solve a quadratic equation, we need to make sure that the equation itself has been set to zero. Sometimes this will require moving terms around in order to make one side zero.
 
As an example, think about the equation 12x2 + 11x + 2 = 7. We could factor the trinomial on the left side of the equation as it is, but we would be left with the equation (4x + 1)(3x + 2) = 7. And this is as far as we could get! All this new equation tells us is that two factors, (4x + 1) and (3x + 2), when multiplied together, equal 7. Setting each factor equal to 7 and then solving the equation does not help us either; we are not looking for factors that are 7; we are looking for two factors that, when multiplied together, equal 7. Put another way, we cannot use the Zero Product Property when there is not a zero on one side of the quadratic equation!
 
What’s the solution here? In order to have a zero on one side of the equation, we have to subtract 7 from both sides. This means our quadratic equation goes from 12x2 + 11x + 2 = 7 to 12x2 + 11x – 5 = 0. We can factor the trinomial on the left and then use the Zero Product Property to find values for x.
 
The example below shows how to solve a quadratic equation where neither side is originally equal to zero. (Note that the factoring sequence has been shortened.)
 
Example
Problem
 
Solve 5b2 + 4 = -12b for b
 
 
 
5b2 + 4 + 12b = -12b + 12b
 
The original equation has
-12b on the right. To make this side equal to 0, add 12b to both sides.
 
5b2 + 12b + 4 = 0
 
Combine like terms.
 
 
5b2 + 10b + 2b + 4 = 0
 
Rewrite 12b for easier grouping and factoring.
 
 
5b(b + 2) + 2(b + 2) = 0
 
Use the Distributive Property to pull out the common factors in the pairs of terms.
 
 
(5b + 2)(b + 2) = 0
 
Use the Distributive Property to pull out the common factor (b + 2). The quadratic is now completely factored.
 
5b + 2 = 0  
 

b + 2 = 0
 
b = -2
 
Apply the Zero Product Property.
Answer
   OR b = -2
 
 
 
 
Sometimes we may factor quadratic equations that end up looking like this: 8(x + 3)(x + 2) = 0. We know how to apply the Zero Product Property to the factors (x + 3) and (x + 2), but what do we do with the leading coefficient of 8? Can we apply the Zero Product Property to an integer?
 
In this situation, we have three factors: 8, x + 3, and x + 2. The Zero Product Rule tells us that if the product of the three factors, 8(x + 3)(x + 2), is going to equal the zero on the right side of the equation, the only way that can happen is if at least one of the three factors on the left side is zero. So let’s check each of them:
 
The factor 8 is never going to be equal to zero, so we can effectively ignore it as one of the choices.
 
The factor x + 3 might equal zero, and we find that when x = -3 then it does.
 
The factor x + 2 might equal zero, and we find that when x = -2 then it does.
 
So our solutions to the original equation are x = -3  or  x = -2, the factor of 8 did not contribute a third solution.
 
Solve for m.
 
2m2 + 10m = 48
 
A) m =  3 or -8
 
B) m = -3 or 8
 
C) m = 0 or -5
 
D) m = 0 or 5
 
Show/Hide Answer
 
 
Summary
 
We can find the solutions, or roots, of quadratic equations by setting one side equal to zero, factoring the polynomial, and then applying the Zero Product Property. The Zero Product Property states that if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0, or both a and b are 0. When the product of factors equals zero, one or more of the factors must also equal zero. Once the polynomial is factored, set each factor equal to zero and solve them separately. The answers will be the set of possible solutions to the original equation.

Quadratic Equation - An equation that can be written in the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. 
For example, 6x2 + 2x + 1 = 0 is a quadratic equation while 6x + 2 is not a quadratic equation.
Factoring - The process of breaking apart of an equation into factors (or separate terms) such that when the separate terms are multiplied together, they produce the original equation.
For example, x2 - x - 2 = (x+1)(x-2). In this case, the equation x2 - x - 2 = 0 can be broken apart into two factors [i.e., (x+1)(x-2) = 0] such that when these two separate terms (i.e., factors) are multiplied together, the result is the original equation.
Basic Factoring

In factoring a basic quadratic equation such as x2 + 6x + 8 = 0, you must find two numbers that add to b (i.e., +6 in this case) and multiply to c (+8 in this case). The numbers +4 and +2 have the properties necessary. Consequently, (x + 4) and (x + 2) are the two factors.

To summarize:

In factoring a quadratic of the form x2 + bx + c, look for two numbers that add to b and multiply to c
Examples of Basic Factoring

If you have not done factoring in years or it is entirely new, you may be confused at this point. However, the following examples and explanation of going between factored and quadratic form should clarify most confusion.

x2 + x - 12 = 0
Find two numbers that add to +1 and multiply to -12.
Two such numbers are +4 and -3.
(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0
x = -4 or x = +3 since each value satisfies the equation (x + 4)(x - 3) = 0.
Another example:

x2 - 3x - 10 = 0
Find two numbers that add to -3 and multiply to -10.
Two such numbers are -5 and +2.
(x - 5)(x + 2) = 0
x = +5 or x = -2 since each value satisfies the equation (x - 5)(x + 2) = 0.
Another example:

x2 + 7x + 6 = 0
Find two numbers that add to +7 and multiply to +6.
Two such numbers are +6 and +1.
(x + 6)(x + 1) = 0
x = -6 or x = -1 since each value satisfies the equation (x + 6)(x + 1) = 0.
Reverse Factoring

The reverse of factoring is called FOIL, which stands for first, outer, inner, last. To acquire the quadratic form (ax2 + bx + c = 0) from the factored form [(x - a)(x - b) = 0]: (1) multiply the first terms, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, and finally the last terms (2) add each of the terms together and simplify. For example:

(x - 4)(x + 2) = ?
First: x(x) = x2
Outer: x(2) = 2x
Inner: (-4)(x) = -4x
Last: -4(2) = -8
(x - 4)(x + 2) = x2 + 2x - 4x - 8 = x2 - 2x - 8
Translating Between Factored and Quadratic Form

Factoring, as defined above, is the process of breaking apart of an equation into factors (or separate terms) such that when the separate terms are multiplied together, they produce the original equation. Factoring works on the following fundamental relationship:

(x - r1)(x - r2) = 0 = x2 + bx + c where r1 and r2 are the roots, or solutions, of the quadratic equation
As an example:

Roots: +6, -4
(x - 6)(x + 4) = ?
x2 + 4x - 6x - 24
x2 - 2x - 24
Consequently, if you saw x2 - 2x - 24 = 0 as a question, you could quickly solve it by factoring it as follows:

x2 - 2x - 24 = 0
(x - 6)(x + 4) = 0
x = 6, -4 since both of these values make the equation (x - 6)(x + 4) = 0 true.
Three Common Forms

There are three common forms that are easily factored. It is essential that you can recognize these three factored forms and quickly work with them:

Difference of Squares

a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
For example:

x2 - 4 = (x + 2)(x - 2)
a = x, b = +2
A Plus B Squared

a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
For example:

x2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)2
a = x, b = +2
A Minus B Squared

a2 - 2ab + b2 = (a - b)2
For example:

x2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)2
a = x, b = +2
Dividing By Zero: Undefined

The rules of mathematics and division in particular state that you cannot divide by zero. Consequently, x divided by zero is undefined just as 1 divided by zero is undefined and 0 divided by 0 is undefined. Further, if you are factoring an equation with a variable in the denominator, any value of that variable that makes the denominator zero is not a legitimate solution. This is best explained and understood with examples.


Begin by factoring the equation as much as possible.
Top: Two numbers that add to +4 and multiply to -12 are +6 and -2.
Bottom: Two numbers that add to +5 and multiply to +4 are +1 and +4.

The solutions (or roots) are x = -6 or x = +2. Since the denominator cannot equal zero, x = -4 or x = -1 [both values that cause the entire denominator to be equal to zero] are not solutions but are instead values of x that cause the entire expression to be undefined.

Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree. A general quadratic equation can be written in the form:



where  represents a variable or an unknown, and , , and  are constants with . (If , the equation is a linear equation. ) Some plots of quadratic functions are shown below.


Plots of Quadratic Equations

Plots of the real-valued quadratic function , varying each coefficient separately.
The constants , , and  are called respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant term or free term. The term "quadratic" comes from quadratus, which is the Latin word for "square". Quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, graphing, Newton's method, and using the quadratic formula.

To solve quadratic equations by factoring, lets remember the FOIL property. FOIL is an acronym for the order in which to multiply out a function. It stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. Before we jump into factoring out a quadratic equation, lets try to FOIL a function:



Remembering this, lets think about how we need to go about factoring out a quadratic equation. Lets do this by using the same example:



The first step is to set up the format: 
Now lets look at how to fill in the variable slots in this format. To do this, we need to take the square root of the first term, or find two terms that will multiply together to the first term of our quadratic. In our example, it is simple, the square root of  is , so lets input this into our format: 
Now, lets look at the constants to put in our equation. We need to have two numbers that (1) add up to the coefficient of our middle term and (2) multiple together to give us the same product of our last term. A good way to do this is make a list of all the numbers whose product is the last term, and make a note of what they add up to. In this example, our last term is 12, so lets make a list of all the numbers that multiply up to 12:  ; ; . We can easily see that the only option here that adds up to 7 is . So lets put this into our equation: 
The last thing to do is input the signs to our equation. A good thing to remember is that two negatives make a positive. So if our last term has a positive sign, then both of the signs in our factored equation are the same. If the last term is has a negative sign, the one of the equations will be negative, and one will be positive. Since we have a positive last term, we know that our equation is going to have the same signs in both terms. Since the middle term is negative, we know that both of our equations will have a negative sign. So now we can complete the factored equation: 
Now we really need to multiply this back out, and make sure it makes sense. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR WORK! When factored out, this returns the original equation, so we know it is correct.
Now, to solve the equation, set each term equal to zero:  and . So,  and 
When you plug either of these terms back into the original equation, they both work. This might seem like a lot of work right now, but after trying a few examples, it will be a lot easier to quickly recognize patterns and do it much more quickly. The key is to practice, practice, practice.

Factoring Quadratics

Factoring quadratics finds the roots or x-intercepts of a quadratic equation. Factoring quadratic equations in standard form, , can often be accomplished by finding two numbers that add to give b, and multiply to give ac. In more complicated equations, use the quadratic formula or completing the square methods. To use the quadratic formula, change the standard form of the quadratic equation to . Find the roots by solving for ±x and substitute into the form . Tocomplete the square, change the standard form of the quadratic equation to where  and , and then solve for x.
